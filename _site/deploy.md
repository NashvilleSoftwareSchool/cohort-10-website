## Deploying Class Site

* Batch re-size photos in Photoshop:
    File > Scripts > ImageProcessor > Select folder > quality 8 > Specifiy width/height > Run

* Get an instructor to create a new repo under the Nashville Software School organization account and have them make you an admin.

* Clone that repo / add it to your repo as the remote "origin"

* Create a new branch called "gh-pages"

* Create or make sure you have a file in the root directory called "CNAME" (no extension) and type the domain name you want to use (i.e. cohort10.nashvillesoftwareschool.com) as the only text in the file.

* When you push to the "gh-pages" branch, your site will be deployed.
