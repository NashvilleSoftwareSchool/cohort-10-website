As an avid education enthusaisast, I like to allow my right-brain to work together with my left-brain to find creative, yet logical, solutions to interactive design and programming problems. I'm looking to join a motivated team. I believe T.E.A.M. means Together Everyone Achieves More. So, if you are looking for a team player to help out on a volunteer project or paid assignment, take a look at my portfolio site and join my network.
